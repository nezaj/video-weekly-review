Phases

[x] 1. Make a simple login flow, After signing in there should be two tabs, one for weekly reviews and another for settings. In the settings tab there should be a log out button that takes me back to the login page

[ ] 2. Implement seeing weekly reviews. Use some mock data. It should feel easy to scroll through previous entries as if I was reading a long text document

[ ] 3. Implement creating new weekly reviews. It should be easy to fill out each section separately and I should feel delighted when I complete all of them. I should be able to edit them as well after submitting

[ ] 4. Implement editing weekly reviews from the view page. I should be able to edit a week or a specific section
