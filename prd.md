Problem:
I want a simple tool that lets me do weekly reviews. In the past I’ve just used a document that was freeform. It worked well in that it was flexible, but I found myself wanting to write too much or the bar of completing the review was too high for me to be consistent.

For 2026 I have three main goals:

- Grow InstantDB
- Plan my wedding
- Get in the best shape of my life

There are ways where I can break this into sub-goals or milestones, but that again feels too heavy for what I want to do for this first version.

For my first review I just used Apple Notes. It works but the UI feels a little sad on my phone.

Solution
Let’s build a personal app that lets me do the following:

- Log weekly reviews in my three categories
- See previous weekly reviews
- Show how many weeks are left in the year
- Let’s me export my data as a note

Opportunity
This could be a much more delightful way to do my weekly reflections. And if for whatever reason I don’t like it, I can always bail out and export my notes back into a text document similar to my previous system!
